# Guest kernel config

The guest kernel config was originally generated for Linux 6.6.4 by running `make defconfig; make kvm_guest.config mod2noconfig` in `lib/linux`. Notable additions include:

```
CONFIG_VIRTIO_MMIO=y
CONFIG_VIRTIO_MMIO_CMDLINE_DEVICES=y
CONFIG_VSOCKETS=y
CONFIG_VIRTIO_VSOCKETS=y
```

All non-virtio devices and hardware-related features are disabled.
